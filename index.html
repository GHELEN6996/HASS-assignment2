                In 2019, the crime rate in Singapore increased by 16.3% to 35,209 reported cases, up from 32,126 reported incidents in 2018. The increase in the number of crimes is attributed to a rise in scam-related cases. If scams were excluded, the total number of reported crimes would have decreased by 4.6% to 25,707 cases in 2019, from 26, 937 in 2018. Four of the six categories of crime saw sharp declines in 2019 from the previous year. Crimes against persons dropped 12.2%, serious property crimes plummeted 26.2%, housebreaking decreased by 14.9% and theft dipped 8%. Motor vehicle and related thefts and robbery and snatch theft cases registered a 35-year low in 2019 with 24.1% and 22.2% declines respectively. Singapore also saw a 5.6% decrease in “Outrage of Modesty (OM)” (rude/inappropriate behavior) cases in 2019. OM cases can range from unwelcome comments or gestures to inappropriate physical contact. Most OM incidents occurred on public transportation, at shopping malls, and popular nightlife venues. Singapore was proud to announce a period of 179 crime-free days in 2019 without any reports of snatch theft, robbery, or burglary.
